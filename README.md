# Work Day Planner
A scheduluer tool to plan out each hour of your work day

## Description
Enter and save a schedule of tasks for each hour of your work day. Task descriptions are saved in local storage, allowing you to come back at any time to review and edit. Future hours are styled green, the current hour is red, and past hours turn to grey as the day progresses.
